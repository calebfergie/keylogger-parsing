# Keylogger Parsing

**This is a repository for my work tracking and analyzing my own keystrokes.**

## Context

This analysis was done in an effort to understand my conscious and subconscious decisions - as part of [NYU ITPs Rest of You](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/roy19/) class.

- **Feb. 4**: Installed [this keylogger](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger) on my mac.
- **Feb. 4 - 23**: Engaged in normal computer use
- **Feb. 23**: Started data analysis

## Data Analysis

I was mostly interested in what keystrokes I typed *in combination* - keyboard shortcuts (e.g. `ctrl+c`, `ctrl+v`, `ctrl+tab`) and repeated key presses (e.g. `tab+tab+tab`, `delete+delete+delete`).

To get at this information, my friend [Rafe](https://www.github.com/HyphnKnight) helped me build a tool to convert the `keystroke.log` file generated by the program into some basic statistics:
 - Frequency of single **commands** typed (e.g. `[return]`,`[left-cmd]`, `[del]`)
 - Frequency of single **non-commands** (single keystrokes) typed (e.g. `t`,`1`, `;`)
 - Frequency of **bigrams** (2 keystroke combinations - e.g. `h`+`i`,`[shift]`+`c`, `[left-cmd]`+`[tab]`)
 - Frequency of **trigrams** (3 keystroke combinations - e.g. `s`+`u`+`p`,`[left-cmd][left-shift]`+`v`, `[left-cmd]`+`[tab]`+`[tab]`)

 This tool is written in javascript and is stored [here](/data-analysis/log-parser.js) in the repository.

**Before doing your own analysis, I recommend cleansing your data - don't upload your sensitive information to the internet!** While this specific keylogging tool doesn't record keystrokes in password fields, be on the lookout of other information like credit card numbers and email addresses.

## Data Visualization

A good way to visualize what I'm interested in is a **[Sankey Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram)**. The visualization at the top of this page was created using [AnswerMiner](https://www.answerminer.com/).

I'm currently working on a custom D3 visualization of the data that will be available online, hence the Express server setup of this repository. Stay tuned.
